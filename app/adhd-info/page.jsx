     <p>ADHD is a common mental health condition. Over time, more and more people are getting diagnosed with ADHD. That’s mostly because more people are aware of ADHD than they used to be.</p>
     <p>Like other mental health conditions, there’s no single explanation for ADHD. Instead, there are a variety of risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop ADHD.</p>

     <p>Some of the risk include:</p>
     <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Brain chemistry and structure:</strong> People with ADHD often show differences in parts of the brain that deal with attention, behavior, and impulse control. However, it’s not possible to reliably distinguish an “ADHD brain” from an average brain. The brain chemicals most relevant to ADHD are dopamine and norepinephrine.</li>
      <li><strong>Sleep deprivation: </strong>Not getting enough sleep, or getting low-quality sleep, can cause ADHD or make symptoms worse. People with ADHD often stay up much later than the average person, making it hard to get enough sleep every night.</li>

      <strong>Hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD</strong>
      <p>Hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD is the least common type of ADHD, but it tends to be the most visible. [1] This type of ADHD presents as symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity without symptoms of inattention. Someone living with hyperactive-impulsive type of ADHD may feel restless and fidget frequently.</p>

      <strong>Inattentive type ADHD</strong>
      <p>People with inattentive type ADHD experience mainly the inattentive symptoms of ADHD. These include lack of focus and being distracted without symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity. This type of ADHD often goes undiagnosed because it’s not as noticeable or disruptive as the hyperactive-impulsive type. For example, children with hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD may interrupt in class making their symptoms hard to ignore. But children with inattentive type ADHD may just look like they’re daydreaming a lot.</p>

      <strong>Combined type ADHD</strong>
      <p>Combined type is the most common type of ADHD. [1] This type of ADHD is called “combined” because it includes both the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms of ADHD. This means that someone who has combined type shows ADHD symptoms that are inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive. Someone living with combined type may experience forgetting daily tasks such as chores and being easily distracted in addition to feeling restless, talking excessively, and/or feeling impatient.</p>

      <strong>What does ADHD feel like?</strong>
<p>ADHD presents in three types of symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity. A person living with ADHD may have one, two, or all three of these types of symptoms. <br/>

The experiences of living with ADHD vary from person to person. Someone may feel frustrated because they can’t get things right the first time. Or a person may be annoyed because they often lose important items like their keys, wallet, or phone. Someone else may become hyper-focused and fixated on ideas, hobbies, or topics and then quickly lose interest. While ADHD may feel or look different for different people, here is a list of common symptoms of ADHD: </p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Often fails to give close attention or makes careless mistakes</li>
      <li>Often has trouble holding attention on tasks and/or activities</li>

      <li>Extreme restlessness or difficulty sitting still</li>
