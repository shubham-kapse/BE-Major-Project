      <p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health condition that appears after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Examples of events might include natural disasters, violent attacks, car accidents, or childhood abuse or neglect. The same event can affect people differently—what’s traumatic for you might not be traumatic for someone else.<br/>

      PTSD usually develops after a single, brief traumatic event. Some forms of trauma occur over long periods of time and can lead to a related condition, Complex PTSD.</p>
      <strong>Symptoms of PTSD:</strong>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Repeatedly thinking about the trauma.</strong> Thoughts about the trauma may come to mind at surprising or inconvenient times. You might have nightmares or flashbacks about the event.</li>
      <li><strong>Being constantly alert or on guard.</strong> You may be easily startled or angered, irritable or anxious, and preoccupied with staying safe. You might become hyper-aware of your surroundings and see danger everywhere.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoiding reminders of the trauma.</strong> You may not want to talk about the event or be around people or places that remind you of the event. You may even forget details about the event or suppress your memories.</li>
      <li><strong>Intense negative emotions and beliefs.</strong> You may feel depressed, anxious, guilty, or angry. You might blame yourself for the trauma, or believe that no one can be trusted.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>Sometimes when we see or experience something really scary, shocking, or harmful, the effects can stay with us for a long time after. If this is a familiar experience for you, you may be dealing with trauma. Anything that is highly stressful to you can be traumatic. Trauma is different for everyone—what seems normal to someone else might be traumatic for you. <br/> <br/>
  
        A traumatic experience can be a threat to your physical safety, like a car accident. It could be something more emotional or social. Trauma can be a one-time event, like a violent attack. Or it can be ongoing, like childhood neglect. Things like abuse, natural disasters, sudden death, bullying, poverty, and discrimination can all induce a trauma response.</p>
