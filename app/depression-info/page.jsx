      <p>Feeling sad is a normal human experience, but feeling too much sadness can cause distress and life problems. When too much sadness affects your life, you might have depression.</p>
      <p>Depression is a type of mental health condition called a mood disorder. Mood disorders occur when changes in mood go beyond the normal ups and downs we all experience from day to day. Episodes of depression last at least two weeks at a time, but sometimes they can last for months or even years.</p>
      <p>Depression goes way beyond just feeling sad. Some of the symptoms that people with depression experience include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Feeling or appearing low, empty inside, or irritable most of the day every day</li>
        <li>Losing interest in activities you would normally enjoy</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite or weight—eating more or less; gaining or losing weight</li>
        <li>Changes in sleep—either not being able to sleep or sleeping too much</li>
        <li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</li>

      <p>Depression is a mental health problem that comes from changes in your brain. The changes relate to how your brain produces and absorbs neurotransmitters, how it’s circuits work, inflammation, and even how it’s built (grey matter). These biological changes can start because you have a family history of depression, or it can start after changes and stressors in your life.</p> <br/>
      <p>Some people feel depressed but don’t understand why. Like there’s nothing to be sad about but I feel so sad and I can’t control these feelings. If you feel this way – it’s possible you have a genetic predisposition to depression, that depression might run in your family, or that you have what professionals call “clinical depression.” There’s no environmental explanation for it -but your brain is changing in a way that causes depression symptoms.</p>

      <p>Everyone feels sad sometimes. It’s natural when we experience moments in life that make us feel overwhelmed, upset, or even hurt. Maybe we just got out of a relationship, we miss someone, or we feel alone. Maybe we tried our hardest but didn’t succeed, or the stress of everyday life is weighing on us. </p> <br/>
      <p>If you’re sad because you lost your job, are going through a breakup, or have lost someone in your life, this is normal. Sadness, even if it feels like extreme sadness, is a natural reaction to events like these. But regular sadness can turn into depression if the feelings don’t get better over time. Or if your mood starts to get in the way of your daily life.</p>
