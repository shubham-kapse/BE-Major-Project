      <p>Eating disorders are mental health conditions that look like unhealthy behaviors, obsessions, and compulsions around food, exercise, and/or body shape. They affect people of all ages, races, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, religions, genders, and sexual orientations. They are the most lethal of any mental health conditions and can have serious health consequences, including osteoporosis, gastric rupture, and Type II Diabetes Mellitus.<br/>

      Most people associate eating disorders with an obsession with being skinny, but they are far more complicated than that. They are thought to result from a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. Many people with eating disorders have other mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other addictions. Trauma, especially sexual trauma, is also very common among individuals with eating disorders. <br/>
      
      While dieting, unhealthy eating, and body image concerns are often dismissed and even promoted in American culture, many of these behaviors will eventually become eating disorders. It’s important to address any symptoms that are having a negative impact on your life and functioning. There is no required severity or body weight that a person must reach before they deserve help or support.</p> <br/>

     <strong>Different types of Eating Disorder are:</strong>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li><strong>Anorexia: </strong>Anorexia involves restricting food intake, significant weight loss, intense fear of weight gain, and a distorted perception of appearance. It’s often accompanied by very specific rules and rituals around food and social isolation.</li>
      <li><strong>Bulimia: </strong>Bulimia involves binging and purging. Binging means a person eats an abnormally large amount of food in a short time frame. They feel ashamed and out of control while eating. Binging is followed by purging in the form of vomiting, laxative or drug use, fasting, or over exercise.</li>
      <li><strong>Binge eating disorder: </strong>Binge eating disorder is diagnosed when a person repeatedly consumes abnormally large amounts of food in short timeframes. It is distinct from overeating in that is causes serious pain and shame and the person feels out of control during binges.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder(OSFED): </strong>formerly referred to as Eating Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS), this is a term used when someone has eating disorder behaviors but doesn’t meet the full clinical guidelines for other eating disorders. For example, a person restricts food intake, has an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of their appearance. They are not classified as being underweight by their doctor, which means they do not meet full criteria for anorexia despite having all the other signs. They would be considered OSFED.</li>

      <p>Most of the images we’re exposed to about eating disorders show very underweight women, but looking at someone is not a good way to determine if they have an eating disorder.<br/>

      Restricting food intake, laxative and diet pill abuse, compulsive exercise, binge eating, and other obsessive and compulsive behaviors around food and exercise don’t necessarily make someone underweight. People with eating disorders can be underweight, can be overweight, and anywhere between. <br/>
      
      Regardless what someone may weigh, eating disorder behaviors can have serious—sometimes fatal—health consequences. They can also destroy your relationships, work, education, and quality of life. <br/>
      
      If your relationship with food, exercise, and your body are getting in the way of your ability to function, is taking up an exorbitant amount of your time and energy, and causing or putting you at risk for health problems, you deserve to feel better. There is no weight you must reach for your struggle to be valid or for you to be allowed to express how you’re feeling.</p>

      <strong>Eating disorders are one of the noisiest mental illnesses.</strong><br/>

When both your mind and body are compromised by such a debilitating illness, it can threaten your life. A major component for people who live with substance use disorders is to avoid the substance that fuels their addiction. For people who live with an eating disorder, your body needs food to live, and you cannot avoid eating to aid in your recovery. It’s an ongoing battle that you’re faced with multiple times a day. <br/>

<strong>People may not notice that you are struggling early on—or ever.</strong><br/>

Eating disordered thoughts often take control slowly and you may not realize what is happening until you are seriously struggling physically, emotionally, and psychologically.

For people with restrictive food behaviors or who exercise compulsively, the people closest to them might assume that if they are eating healthier or exercising more that they are making healthy choices.

    <br/>
   <strong> Managing your stress level</strong> <br/>
If you’re eating because of stress, then managing your stress will naturally help you manage your eating. Techniques you use to manage stress are called coping skills. Stress eating is one example of a coping skill; we do it because it makes us feel better in the moment.

Coping skills can be healthy or unhealthy. Usually what makes them unhealthy is when we rely on a single coping skill too much. For example, most people can drink a beer now and then to relax, but if that’s your go-to every time you’re stressed, it will likely become a problem for you. <br/>

<strong>Your relationship with food</strong><br/>
Food is something we need to survive. It provides nutrients that keep us alive and healthy. It reminds us of home and makes us feel safe… and of course, it tastes good. There’s nothing wrong with any of that; food should be something we enjoy, not something we feel guilty about.
